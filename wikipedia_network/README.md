# Generating a Network from a Wikipedia Page!

This project has the goal to generate a network from a single **Wikipedia** page (seed page) and to analyze how the pages are connected to each other based on different metrics. 

Due to the amount of computational power and time to process all data, we are only exploring the network until the second layer, which already include a lot of nodes and connections to be analyzed. 

Another goal of this project is to create a pipeline that receives a starting page from wikipedia and includes all the processing data phases. 


It's impotant to mention that this project is a collaboration between the students [Aryel Medeiros](https://github.com/aryelmedeiros) and [Deborah Moreira](https://github.com/deborahmoreira)
